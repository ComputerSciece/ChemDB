npm install


You may have to run the NPM install commands for the angular/cli as well as font awesome as well. 

If having issues, try running these two commands. 

"npm install @angular/cli"
"npm install font-awesome"


ng serve --open   (This starts the server, and adding --open makes it open a web browser once the webpack is compiled)
